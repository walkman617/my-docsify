# Flutter跨平台应用开发技术（实践）

## Practice 01: [Write your first Flutter app, part 1](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/first-flutter-app-pt1#0)

Create a simple mobile app that generates proposed names for a startup company. In part one, you’ll use a package that returns pairs of words at random and inserts them into an infinite scrolling list. You can also find this [codelab on flutter.dev](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/codelab).

## Practice 02: [Write Your First Flutter App, part 2](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/first-flutter-app-pt2#0))

Create a simple mobile app that generates proposed names for a startup company. In part two, you’ll extend the example from part 1 to allow the user to select favorite word pairs, and add a second “Saved Favorites” page where users can view the selected names. Finally, you’ll change the app’s theme color.

## Practice 03: [Building layouts](https://flutter.dev/docs/development/ui/layout/tutorial)

This guide then takes a step back to explain Flutter’s approach to layout, and shows how to place a single widget on the screen. After a discussion of how to lay widgets out horizontally and vertically, some of the most common layout widgets are covered.

## Practice 04: [Adding interactivity to your Flutter app](https://flutter.dev/docs/development/ui/interactive)

How do you modify your app to make it react to user input? In this tutorial, you’ll add interactivity to an app that contains only non-interactive widgets. Specifically, you’ll modify an icon to make it tappable by creating a custom stateful widget that manages two stateless widgets.
