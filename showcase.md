# Flutter跨平台应用开发实战

## Practice 1: [Write your first Flutter app on the web](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/codelab-web)

Implement a simple web app in DartPad (no downloads required!) that displays a sign-in screen containing three text fields. As the user fills out the fields, a progress bar animates along the top of the sign-in area. This codelab is written specifically for the web, but if you have downloaded and configured Android and iOS tooling, the completed app works on Android and iOS devices, as well.

## Practice 2: [Building beautiful UIs with Flutter](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/flutter#0) 

A deeper “first dive” than “Write your first Flutter app.” Create a chat app that includes a simple animation, and customizes the UI for iOS and Android. As part of this codelab, learn how to use keyboard shortcuts in Android Studio.

## Practice 3: [How to test a Flutter app](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/flutter-app-testing/#0) 

Start with a simple app that manages state with the Provider package. Unit test the provider package. Write widget tests for two of the widgets. Use Flutter Driver to create an integration test.
